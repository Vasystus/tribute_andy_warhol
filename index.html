    <h1>Andy Warhol</h1>
    <h2> Artist, Painter, Film Director, Innovator
    </h2>
    <p> The name of American artist <strong>Andy Warhol</strong> is all but synonymous with <strong>Pop art</strong>, the movement he helped shape in the 1960s. He is known for his clever appropriation of motifs and images from popular advertising and commercials, which he integrated into graphic, vibrant works that utilized mass-production technologies such as printmaking, photography and silkscreening. Later in his career, he expanded his oeuvre to include other forms of media, founding <em><strong>Interview</strong></em> magazine, managing the experimental rock band <em><strong>The Velvet Underground</strong></em> and producing fashion shoots and films on-site at <strong>The Factory</strong>, his world-famous studio in New York. <strong> Warhol </strong> was phenomenally prolific, and the archive of works he left behind, not to mention his own personal collection of art, photographs, antiques and the daily paper trail from his studio, squirreled away in his “<em><strong>time capsules</strong></em>,” is beyond vast.
